# Covid-19-Data
Exploratory analysis of covid-19 data provided by Our World in Data as of March 4, 2022. In this project I performed a few data cleaning tasks
and practiced writing more complex queries in order to extract useful data. For visualizations I mimicked the charts and visuals available on
the WHO website.

Tableau visuals can be accessed [here.](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19EDA_16469541827660/WeeklyChangeDashboard?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
